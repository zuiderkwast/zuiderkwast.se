Soft shackles
=============

Soft shackles is a lightweight alternative to steel and aluminium schackles and carabiners. First used in sailing, emerging used in slacklining and other sports. Typically, they are made of [Dyneem®/Amsteel/UHMWPE fiber](uhmwpe-fiber.md) as it is the world's strongest fiber.

Benefits compared to steel counterpart:

  * Strong – comparable to steel of the same width
  * Light – strength-to-weight ratio more than ten times that of steel
  * Abrasion-resistant, very low friction, UV resistant and all the other benefits of the [UHMWPE fiber](uhmwpe-fiber.md)
  * Easy to make yourself
  * Cheap ̣– if you make them yourself

*Note:* Don't use shoft shackles in the presense of sharp edges as these can cut through the material.

How to make soft shackles
-------------------------

It is easy to make soft shackles and there are many resources online. As a starting point I recommend the soft shackle articles at [L-36.com](http://l-36.com/soft_shackles.php?menu=4). You don't even need any special tools to make shoft shackles. The interior of a pen can be used as a splicing tool.

There are several variations of the design. My favourite variant is the *High strength soft shackle* which involves a [button knot](http://l-36.com/button_knot_top.php) (credited to Brion Toss) although different variations have their pros and cons. Accordning to tests at L-36.com, the strength of the *high strength* variant has 230% the strength of the line used while "conventional" soft shackles with a diamond knot have 170% the strength of the line.

<tr><td>3mm</td><td>10kN</td><td>17kN</td><td>23kN</td></tr>
<tr><td>4mm</td><td>20kN</td><td>34kN</td><td>46kN</td></tr>

<tr><td>7mm</td><td>54kN</td><td>92kN</td><td>124kN</td></tr>
<tr><td>9mm</td><td>69kN</td><td>117kN</td><td>159kN</td></tr>

The above table contains approximate values. The strength can vary between different types of Dyneema line. Dyneema line can be bought in sailing shops and e-stores.
