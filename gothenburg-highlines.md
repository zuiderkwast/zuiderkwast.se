Lines:

* [Gone With the Wind](gone-with-the-wind.md), 22m
* [Don Genaro](don-genaro.md), 50m
* [Forever Young](forever-young.md), 67m

Directions: You can take bus 58 to Ungmästaregatan or bus 519 to Frimästaregatan. Both these buses leave from the central station.

By car: Parking is best done on the street Kanngjutaregatan or on Gärdsåsgatan. Don't park on Ungmästaregatan. The locals don't like that.

In May 2015 we had a highline meeting here. Martin Borgvall took some [photos that are available on his website](http://www.illbattingbild.com/highline).

Gothia Towers
-------------

In 2014 there was a 25m/60m line rigged between the hotel towers and walked by Stefan Drouget, Olle Romberg and Petter Edderkopp.
