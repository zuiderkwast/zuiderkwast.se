The UHMWPE fiber
================

This is more often called Dyneema. During the spring of 2015 I became interested in this material and started to experiment with it. This is what I did:

* [Soft shackles](soft-shackles.md)
* [Dyneema trousers](uhmwpe-trousers.md)

About the material
------------------

The *UHMWPE fiber*, more commonly known by the names *Dyneema* and *Spectra*, is one of the strongest fibers in the world. UHMWPE stands for ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene. UHMWPE in itself is not that strong, but when spun to fibers, the molecules are aligned. Thus it is important to distinguish *UHMWPE fibers* from solid *UHMWPE* plastic.

According to the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-molecular-weight_polyethylene#Fiber), the yield strength is comparable to that of high-strength steels while being lighter that water. That gives a strength-to-weight ratio of 8â€“15 times higher than that of steel and 40% higher than that of aramid.

Dyneema lines and ropes are about 60% of the diameter and 30% of the weight of equally strong polyester or nylon lines according to [DyneemaSK75 Tech Sheet PDF, www.pelicanrope.com](www.pelicanrope.com/pdfs/DyneemaSK75_Tech_Sheet.pdf).

For a comparison to other materials, see the Wikipedia article [Ultimate tensile strength](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength#Typical_tensile_strengths), section Typical tensile strengths.

Properties
----------

  * High strength
  * Low weight
  * Almost no stretch
  * Slippery, i.e. very low friction (comparable to Teflon) and self-lubricating
  * Dries quickly, i.e. hydrophobic
  * Extremely durable and abrasion resistant
  * Resistant to moisture, UV light and chemicals
  * Odorless, tasteless and nontoxic

Applications
------------

  * Bullet-proof body armor
  * Puncture-resistant clothing for fencing
  * Enforcements for motorcycle jeans and other protective clothing
  * Cut-resistant gloves
  * Bow strings
  * Fishing line
  * Lines for parashutes, paraglidersh)
  * Lines for sailing and kites
  * Slings for climbing equipment
  * [Soft shackles](soft-shackles.md), a connector primarily used in sailing
