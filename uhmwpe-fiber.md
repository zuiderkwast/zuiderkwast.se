================

UHMWPE is the strongest fiber in the world. It is more commonly known under the brand name Dyneema. During the spring of 2015 I became interested in this material and started to experiment with it. This is what I did:

* [Soft shackles](soft-shackles.md)
* [Dyneema trousers](uhmwpe-trousers.md)
